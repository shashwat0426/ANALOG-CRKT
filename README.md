# BASIC-ANALOG-CRKT

THIS IS A COLLECTION OF BASIC ANALOG CRKT:-    

DC TRANSIENT ANALYSIS (ctrl+alt+t):- 
put transient time in nano sec. otherwise it will be difficult to analyse.

RECTIFIERS                     
CLIPPERS                                     
CLAMPERS 
OP-AMP   

AC CHARACTERISTICS ANALYSIS (ctrl+alt+a):-
frequency must be in the order of GHz for complete analysis

FILTERS                                                  
BJT- AMPLIFIER                                                                                          
NOTE :--  ALL THE CIRCUITS ARE MADE IN TINA-TI TOOL (a simulation software by Texas Instruments)
